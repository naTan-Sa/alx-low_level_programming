# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

## Description
This project is part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum. It focuses on creating and using functions, nested loops, and working with the `_putchar` function in C. 

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain:

- What nested loops are and how to use them.
- What a function is and how to use functions.
- The difference between a declaration and a definition of a function.
- What a function prototype is.
- Scope of variables.
- GCC flags: `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`.
- What header files are and how to use them with `#include`.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using GCC.
- All files should end with a new line.
- Your code must follow the Betty style guidelines.
- No global variables allowed.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- Standard library functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc. are forbidden; `_putchar` is allowed.
- Your header file should be called `main.h` and contain all function prototypes, including `_putchar`.
