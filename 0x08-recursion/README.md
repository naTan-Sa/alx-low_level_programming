# 0x08. C - Recursion

## Overview
This project focuses on recursion in C.  
You will learn how to solve problems by having functions call themselves, design base cases, and avoid infinite recursion while working with strings, numbers and advanced pattern-matching.

## Concepts
- Recursion and recursive thinking  
- Recursive string manipulation  
- Recursive numeric algorithms (factorial, power, sqrt, prime checks)  
- Helper functions and recursion without loops  
- Wildcard pattern matching with recursion  

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain what recursion is and how it works  
- Implement recursion correctly in C (base case + recursive step)  
- Know when recursion is appropriate and when to prefer iteration  
- Use recursion to manipulate strings and perform numeric algorithms

## Requirements
- Editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`  
- Compiler: `gcc` on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS  
- Options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`  
- Code must follow Betty style  
- No global variables, max 5 functions per file  
- No use of standard library functions like `printf`, `puts` (you may use `_putchar`)  
- All prototypes, including `_putchar`, must be in `main.h`  
- You are **not allowed** to use loops or static variables

## Tasks
- `0-puts_recursion.c` — Print a string followed by a new line (`_puts_recursion`)  
- `1-print_rev_recursion.c` — Print a string in reverse (`_print_rev_recursion`)  
- `2-strlen_recursion.c` — Return the length of a string (`_strlen_recursion`)  
- `3-factorial.c` — Return the factorial of a number (`factorial`)  
- `4-pow_recursion.c` — Return the value of `x` raised to the power `y` (`_pow_recursion`)  
- `5-sqrt_recursion.c` — Return the natural square root of a number (`_sqrt_recursion`)  
- `6-is_prime_number.c` — Return 1 if a number is prime, 0 otherwise (`is_prime_number`)  
- `100-is_palindrome.c` — Return 1 if a string is a palindrome, 0 otherwise (`is_palindrome`)  
- `101-wildcmp.c` — Compare strings with wildcard `*` support (`wildcmp`)
