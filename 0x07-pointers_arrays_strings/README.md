# 0x07. C - Even More Pointers, Arrays and Strings

## Overview
This project focuses on advanced manipulation of pointers, arrays, and strings in C.  
You will learn how to copy memory, locate characters and substrings, manipulate buffers, work with multidimensional arrays, and handle double pointers without relying on the standard library (except `_putchar`).

## Concepts
- Pointers and arrays  
- Strings manipulation  
- Memory layout and buffers  
- Multi-dimensional arrays  
- Double pointers  

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain and use pointers, arrays, and double pointers  
- Understand memory layout of arrays and strings  
- Implement functions that manipulate memory and strings without the standard library  
- Print buffers and chessboards using pointers  
- Work with matrices and calculate diagonal sums  
- Set pointer values dynamically  

## Requirements
- Editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`  
- Compiler: `gcc` on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS  
- Options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`  
- Code must follow Betty style  
- No global variables, maximum 5 functions per file  
- No standard library functions allowed (except `_putchar`)  
- Include function prototypes in `main.h`  

## Tasks
- **0-memset.c** – Fill memory with a constant byte  
- **1-memcpy.c** – Copy memory area  
- **2-strchr.c** – Locate a character in a string  
- **3-strspn.c** – Get the length of a prefix substring  
- **4-strpbrk.c** – Search a string for any of a set of bytes  
- **5-strstr.c** – Locate a substring  
- **6-print_chessboard.c** – Print the chessboard  
- **7-print_diagsums.c** – Print the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix  
- **100-set_string.c** – Set the value of a pointer to a char  
- **101-crackme_password** – Contain the password for the `crackme2` executable
