# 0x05. C - Pointers, Arrays and Strings

## Overview

This project focuses on mastering **pointers, arrays, and strings** in C.  
You will learn how to manipulate memory, work with strings, and understand array and pointer relationships.

---

## Concepts

- Pointers and arrays  
- Strings manipulation  
- Memory layout  
- Variable scope

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain and use pointers and arrays  
- Understand the difference between pointers and arrays  
- Manipulate strings using pointers and arrays  
- Work with variable scope and memory

---

## Requirements

- **Editors:** `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`  
- **Compiler:** `gcc` on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS  
- **Options:** `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`  
- Code must follow **Betty style**  
- No global variables, max **5 functions per file**  
- **No standard library functions** (except `_putchar`)  
- Include function prototypes in `main.h`
