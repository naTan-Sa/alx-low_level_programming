# 0x06. C - More Pointers, Arrays and Strings

## Overview
This project focuses on **advanced manipulation of pointers, arrays, and strings in C**.  
You will learn how to concatenate, copy, and compare strings, reverse arrays, capitalize words, encode text, and work with buffers and numbers without relying on the standard library (except `_putchar`).

## Concepts
- Pointers and arrays  
- Strings manipulation  
- Memory layout and buffers  
- Variable scope  

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:  
- Explain and use pointers and arrays  
- Understand the difference between pointers and arrays  
- Manipulate strings and arrays using pointers  
- Work with variable scope and memory  
- Implement encoding schemes like ROT13 and 1337  
- Print numbers and buffers using `_putchar`  

## Requirements
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs  
- Compiler: gcc on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS  
- Options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`  
- Code must follow **Betty style**  
- No global variables, maximum **5 functions per file**  
- No standard library functions (except `_putchar`)  
- Include function prototypes in `main.h`  

## Tasks
- `0-strcat.c` – Concatenate two strings  
- `1-strncat.c` – Concatenate n bytes of two strings  
- `2-strncpy.c` – Copy a string  
- `3-strcmp.c` – Compare two strings  
- `4-rev_array.c` – Reverse an array of integers  
- `5-string_toupper.c` – Convert all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase  
- `6-cap_string.c` – Capitalize all words of a string  
- `7-leet.c` – Encode a string into 1337  
- `100-rot13.c` – Encode a string using ROT13  
- `101-print_number.c` – Print an integer using `_putchar`  
- `102-magic.c` – Pointer arithmetic to print a specific array element  
- `103-infinite_add.c` – Add two numbers stored as strings  
- `104-print_buffer.c` – Print a buffer in hexadecimal and ASCII
